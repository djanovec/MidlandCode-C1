## CSS To the Extreme!

So there are a lot more things that you can do with CSS that we haven't done in class. The biggest two are going to be transforms and transitions. There are a lot more than that however. We wil be reviewing those major two in depth more, but here are some more fun CSS tools to play with if you want to explore them:

* Animations - Theses can be set up for a continuous animation or to go along preset `keyframes` to create interesting effects. More information can be found [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation)
* Clip-path - This allows for interesting shapes to be created via CSS as opposed to utilizing something like canvas. You can play with it [here](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) and see one of the best utilizations of it [here](http://www.species-in-pieces.com/)
* Gradients - Allows for more than just the use of a single color in attributes allowing for a set color, like `color: ` or `background-color: `
