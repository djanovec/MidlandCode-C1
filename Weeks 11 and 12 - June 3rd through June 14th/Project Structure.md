# Final Group Project

## General Overview
The final project will consist of two groups of 6 and will mimic a real world environment including communicating with a client, meeting deadlines, and demoing completed steps to the client. The clients for this project will be members of the MU staff and are going to be acting as such. This will be much less hands for the instructors than any of the previous projects. In order to better simulate actual working conditions you will (with no input from any staff or instructor) elect two people from your team to act as team leads as outlined below.

## Team Structure

Each team will need to decide (as a group) on the following things:
* Team Name - This can be anything that is work appropriate
* Tech Lead - 
    * Would effectively be the scrum master on a normal team
    * All technical problems should run through this person (in addition to team members)
    * They are the only ones who can seek help from instructors (explained more below)
* Client Lead
    * Would effectively be the product owner on a normal team
    * All demo meetings should be facilitated by this person
    * They are the only ones who can communicate with the clients (explained more below)

## The Clients
Each of the teams are going to be assigned clients. These are the only people your team should consult regarding questions about design or functionality. Any questions directed toward instructors will be directed back towards the clients. Your clients lead above should be the ONLY one communicating with the client. They are to act as the liaison between the group and the client. If anyone outside of the client lead tries to communicate with them, the clients will redirect that team member back towards the client lead.

The clients have plans for a product you will be creating but much like real life clients they do NOT have a full layout or mockup to show you. They also do not have the technical knowledge in order to tell you what techs to use or not use. It will be your job to determine what they want and take advantage of the demos you will have (see below) with them to figure out if you are or are not on the right track. The clients will also be upset (remember these are your clients who are "paying" you so act accordingly) if you are not meeting deadlines or are showing them things they did not ask for, do not want, or do not like. 

## Project Process
### Starting Order
1. Select your Client Lead, Tech Lead, and Team Name - 5-10 mins
2. Meet with the Clients to Determine their needs
    * Meeting will be lead by the clients and the client lead
    * ALL team members are encouraged to ask questions and take notes. This will reduce the amount of back and forth AFTER the meeting before you can get started.
    * Remember that the clients are the ones who make final decisions. They are also the ones "paying" you for your work and should be treated as such. 
    * Brock, Mike, and/or Ray will be in this meeting ONLY to observe the process. No questions should be directed to them and they should not be considered part of the client group.
3. Discuss your plan of attack by breaking out the project into user stories and assign first steps to each team member. You can use pair programming or individual work as you see fit. Remember you are going to be working off two day sprints (see schedule below) so make sure you are breaking things up accordingly.
4. Communicate with the clients as to what they should expect at the next product demo. 

### Project Schedule

Once you have the initial plan of attack you will be working off two day sprints to complete the project in demo-able chunks. You will be expected to demo these chunks to the clients and obtain feedback on how to proceed. Make sure that ANY guarantees you have given the client can be met and are not so small that the client will lose faith in your ability to meet the final deadline.

### Coding Help and Structure

Each team will have a github repository already created for them and the entire team will be given access to it. ONLY the tech lead will have access to push to the master branch however. Any merges into master that need to be done will have to take the form of a pull request that only the tech lead can approve. This is to mirror the structure of a normal team where you would never be given access to the master branch. 

The other major change from previous group projects is how help will be given during the project. In order to also better simulate a real world team, you will be expected to work as a team to solve any tech problems that arise. If a problem arises that the entirety of the team cannot solve, the tech lead and ONLY the tech lead should then reach out to Brock, Mike, or Ray. If anyone outside of the tech lead for a team reaches out for assistance they will be directed back to the tech lead. You will need to work as a team for this much like you would in the real world. Make sure you're selecting your tech leads to be the person you want to represent your team on any tech issues.
