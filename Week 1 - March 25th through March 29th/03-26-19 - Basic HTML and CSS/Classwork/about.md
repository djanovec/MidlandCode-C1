## Simple About Page

Using this picture: 

![about.jpg](./about.jpg)

Create a simple web page with all the requisite styling. Not shown in the image, the following style should also be applied:
* On hover, the links should change to an orange color.
* Visited links should be red.
* When the Image is hovered over, the rounded edges should disappear.

After the above is done, change the colors so that they match better. Also, utilize rgb() color schemes for all colors, and change the fonts to be:
* The top heading and sub-heading should be one font
* the lists should be a second font
* The footer should be a third font.
* at least one font should come from google fonts via a `<link>` tag and at least one via importing into the stylesheet
