## Docker and Containerization

### What is containerization?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. This allows for much better cross platform functionality and allows the application to run the exact same regardless of server or computer architecture.

### Containers vs Virtual Machines

### How can Docker help in development?
* The huge thing is the above comment of consistent functionality. 
* Standardization of applications is huge during the entirety of the dev lifecycle. 
* Massively speeds up deployment
* Allows for consistency across environments to allow for continuous deployment and testing
* Segregation and Security. By having everything contained (literally) in it's own space it reduces cross contamination of any malicious code / security vulnerabilities that might exist on a non containerized application
